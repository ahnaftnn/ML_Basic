#KNN_Kmeans.ipynb
This project applies Machine Learning classification and clustering techniques on a breast cancer dataset.
The workflow includes preprocessing, encoding, normalization, clustering using K-Means, and classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

📌 Project Overview

This notebook performs the following machine learning tasks:
